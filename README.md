## ðŸš©Project Description

> This project involved the transformation of raw data from various sources into a structured relational database using SQL Server. The primary goal was to adhere to the principles of Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure efficient data organization. Additionally, a star schema was implemented to facilitate business intelligence and analytics.

## ðŸš©Key Objectives

>Data Transformation: Raw data from diverse sources was processed and converted into relational tables within SQL Server. This process involved cleaning, standardizing, and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis.

>Normalization: The data was organized following the Third Normal Form (3NF) standards. This ensured that data redundancy was minimized, and data integrity was maintained throughout the database.

>Star Schema Design: To support efficient analytics and reporting, a star schema was designed. This schema simplifies complex data structures, making it easier to extract meaningful insights from the database.

>Key Assignment: Primary and foreign keys were designated within the database to establish relationships between tables. This ensured data consistency and integrity.

>SQL Queries: Common SQL queries were pre-programmed to provide valuable insights. These queries focused on determining the most frequently prescribed medication types and analyzing trends in prescription claims' prices.
